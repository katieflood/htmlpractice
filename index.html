				I graduated from college in May with a degree in Linguistics and was lucky enough to find a job that's encouraging me to get my feet wet in software engineering. I'm realizing I should have kept up with my CS courses in college (RIP my Python knowledge from freshman fall), so I'm teaching myself whatever I can, whenever I can.
